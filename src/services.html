              <p>This treatment is based on the Fibonacci sequence and Sacred Geometry. It involves placing each of the 9 forks on the 8 extraordinary vessels or other parts of the body. These forks integrate the Hermetic Principle: As above so below, as within so without creating a deep connection between each of us and the greater universe.  Sessions aid in the journey towards optimal health and inner enlightenment. They can also assist in creating harmonic balance of mind, body and spirit within the cosmos.</p>

              <div class="price">$35 for 45 Minutes+</div>
              <p>Gong Therapy has been practiced for thousands of years, bathing you in meditative sound waves. The vibration of the gong creates deep relaxation by synchronizing brain wave patterns (Alpha, Beta and Theta) from the sounds of the Gongs. It has been described as a sound massage for the body, mind and spirit. In this relaxed state, healing can take place much easier.</p>
              <p>Private sessions at your home are also available. Fuel charges may apply depending on distance travelled and will be discussed when you book your appointment.</p>
