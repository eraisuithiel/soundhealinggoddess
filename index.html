      <h1>What is Sound Healing?</h1>

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <p>I had my first Acutonics treatment in the Summer of 2017. It was my second time trying this technique. Having had breast and bone cancer over a long period of time ( I am healed now), and two major back operations (my spine is supported by two titanium rods, from top to bottom), I was looking for a treatment to alleviate the pain I have on a daily basis. The treatment with QZ went as follow: she took time to ask me questions and to make me feel comfortable by explaining her approach, showing me the tools she uses, and offering me tea! She also asked if I had any questions or concerns. QZ is 150% (!) present and focus on the patient, as well as very professional. Once I was on the table, she made sure I was not too cold or too hot, and started her treatment. The treatment itself was very different from the previous acutonic treatment I had received. It’s hard to explain concretely. All I can say is that it was working on another level. A very deep level of consciousness. Beyond the physical. As a result, later on during the next few days, some emotional issues resurfaced and found its answers. I also felt very “protected” during the treatment. I could totally let go and just “be”. I was very happy about the result. It also helped my back .” - <em>Sylvie S. Montreal Quebec</em></p>
